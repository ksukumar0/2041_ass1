# Limitations of plpy.pl

Print statements
*	complex print statements like
print "$var12 is not even", "\t", $var13, "this number is odd"; 
* will not translate properly

Variable type recognition
* string concatnation isnt recognised by the compiler. e.g:
$str = "hello";
$str2 = "world";
$str3 = $str.$str2;

Code + comment
* The compiler will have trouble if the code and comment are placed on the same line. This needs to be handled.

Strings can be manipulated in control statements even if they are quoted
